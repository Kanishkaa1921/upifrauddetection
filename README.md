# upifrauddetection
Overview
The UPI Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based solution designed to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payment systems. This project leverages advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning models to classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

Features
Detects fraudulent UPI transactions using supervised learning models.
Preprocessing of raw transactional data, including feature engineering and handling imbalanced datasets.
Real-time fraud detection and alert generation using a web interface.
User-friendly interface built with HTML, CSS, and Flask.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy
Web Framework: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Project Workflow
Data Collection:

Collect transactional data, including features like transaction amount, location, time, and user details.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values, normalize data, and engineer relevant features.
Address class imbalance using oversampling techniques like SMOTE.
Model Development:

Train machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to classify transactions.
Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Web Application:

Build a web interface to upload transaction data and display results in real time.
Generate alerts for suspicious transactions.
Deployment:

Deploy the application locally or on a cloud platform for end-user access.
